##  Project description

In this project, we developed a advanced NLP model using attention mechanism  which can provide instant Customer Support and resolve their queries. Where our model is even capable to retrain and productionize itself. It can be integrated in various domains like banking, insurance, online education, etc. depending on client's needs ,where client doesn't need to have any prior technical knowledge ,they just have to use it as a plug & play model. 

##  core Idea - Intent Classification

Intent classification is the automated categorization of text data based on customer goals.

In essence, an intent classifier automatically analyzes texts and categorizes them into intents such as Purchase, Downgrade, Unsubscribe, and Demo Request. This is useful to understand the intentions behind customer queries, automate processes, and gain valuable insights.

Ultimately, every customer interaction has a purpose, an aim, or intention. Whether they want to make a purchase, request more information, or unsubscribe, you should respond quickly to improve customer retention rates, loyalty and satisfaction.
